Promise
==========

* Node. js Promise is a placeholder for a value that will be available in the future,
* allowing us to handle the result of an asynchronous task once it has completed or encountered an error.
* Promises make writing asynchronous code easier. 
* They're an improvement on the callback pattern and very popular in Node. js.

callback
=========
* A callback is a function which is called when a task is completed, 
 thus helps in preventing any kind of blocking and a callback function allows other code to run in the meantime. 
* Callback is called when task get completed and is asynchronous equivalent for a function.
